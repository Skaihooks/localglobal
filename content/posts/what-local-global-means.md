title: 'What Local Global Means'
---



Welcome to **Local-Global**!



This site is intended to explore ideas at the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, language, design, ecology, and human problem spaces. 



## Why "Local-Global"?



In creating a title for this site I was initially drawn towards phrases using mathematical language as a reflection of my academic specialization. However, I decided against this for one reason: The ideas I like to engage with tend to span across many disciplines, math being just one. The perspective I'm trying to adopt for this site and for my future research emphasizes understanding *how local decisions, events, or objects interact with global systems*, whether in mathematics or elsewhere. Hence, local-global.
